# About Me

Hi, I'm Oumaima. A full-stack software developer with a strong focus on backend engineering, clean architecture, and building systems that are both robust and understandable.

My day-to-day work revolves around **Java**, **Spring Boot / Quarkus**, and **Angular**. I enjoy designing APIs, shaping domain models, and thinking carefully about how software evolves over time. Topics such as error handling, testing strategies, architectural trade-offs, and code quality are recurring themes in both my work and my writing.

This blog is where I document what I learn, build, and reflect on as a developer.

Here you'll find:
- Technical articles about Java, backend patterns, and frontend integration
- Architectural reflections and practical engineering lessons
- Personal experiences about teamwork, mentorship, and growing in the field
- Occasional creative or humorous takes on software development

## Community Involvement

Beyond my professional work, I'm actively involved in the developer community.

I help organize and run **CoderDojo**, where I introduce kids and teenagers to programming and computational thinking. Teaching others has become one of the most rewarding parts of my journey, it constantly reminds me to keep things simple, clear, and fun.
In addition, I organize and continue to run initiatives such as **JTires**, a learning and experimentation program within my workplace that I actively helped set up and still coordinate. During these informal but highly educational sessions, we explore new technologies, build side projects, and practice mob programming together.

I strongly believe that initiatives like this are essential. They create safe space to learn without pressure, to make mistakes, to share knowledge, and to grow as a team. For me, JTires is not just a coding session, but a way to foster a learning culture where collaboration, curiosity, and continuous improvement are central.

I’m also a co-host of the podcast **[JCast](https://jcast.dev)**, together with two close (and slightly crazy) friends. In JCast, we talk about IT, technology, hobbies, and the everyday realities of working in software. It’s something I genuinely love doing, we laugh a lot, challenge each other’s ideas, reflect on our experiences, and most of all have a great time together.

The podcast is both a creative outlet and a way for me to share stories, connect with others in the field, and highlight the human side of software development: the fun, the frustrations, and everything in between.

## My Philosophy

For me, software development goes beyond code. It's about **people, collaboration, and curiosity**. I believe the best systems are built when you think not only about technical perfection, but also about the people who work with it, use it, and maintain it in the future.

I strive to create software that is robust, maintainable, and clear, but equally important is the **human side of technology**. Clear communication, empathy, and understanding others are just as essential as clean architecture and well-written code.

Learning and knowledge sharing are at the heart of how I work. Whether it's colleagues, children at **CoderDojo**, side-project teams during **JTires**, or listeners of **JCast**, I aim to foster environments where everyone can grow, make mistakes, and enjoy the process.

For me, software development is a human adventure. It's about **connection, curiosity, and continuous growth**. Code is the tool, but **people make the difference**.

If you're here to learn, reflect, or simply enjoy stories about code and collaboration: welcome. 

Feel free to connect. I'm always happy to talk about software, architecture, and ideas.

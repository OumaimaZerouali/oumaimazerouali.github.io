> "It started with three developers and a microphone."

If there’s one thing we love as devs—besides solving problems and shipping code—it’s talking about the journey. 
The highs, the bugs, the coffee-fueled nights. 
That’s exactly why we started **JCast**.

JCast is a Dutch-language podcast hosted by me and two awesome colleagues, Viktor and Maarten. 
We’re developers with different experiences, opinions, and code habits, but we share one thing: a passion for talking tech in a way that’s real. 
No buzzword bingo. No sales talk. Just devs chatting about the stuff that matters (and sometimes doesn’t).

### How It Started
For a long time, I had this vague dream of starting a podcast. 
I didn’t know when, how, or with whom — just that I wanted to share honest conversations about being a developer today.

Then one day I casually brought it up at work. 
One colleague was immediately excited, another jumped in with the final push: “Let’s actually do this.” 
One brainstorm later — language, format, name — and **JCast** was born.

Our slogan is *Java als startpunt, alles daarrond als speelveld* (Java as a starting point, everything around it as a playground). 
It’s our cozy “praatbarak” about software development, tech, and all the messy, interesting stuff around it.

###  Episode 1: What *Is* a Professional Developer, Anyway?
This first episode was a special one. 
Not just because it was our debut — but because we tackled a question that’s been quietly sitting in the minds of so many devs (ourselves included):

**What does it really mean to be a “professional” developer?**
The inspiration came from Uncle Bob’s book *Clean Code*, which makes a strong case for professionalism as a mindset — not just a job title. 
We discussed what parts of that message resonate with us today, and where we’ve started to question or reinterpret those ideas based on our own experience.

Some things we explored:
* 💡 What do *we* mean when we say “professional”? Is it about writing tests? Is it about taking ownership? Communication?
* 🧠 How do you balance idealistic principles like TDD with the messy reality of deadlines and legacy code?
* 🔍 What habits have made us better devs — and which ones do we still struggle with?
* 💬 When do you push for quality, and when do you just ship it?

We each brought different perspectives: some of us lean more toward principles, others toward pragmatism. 
But that’s what made the conversation real — not polished takes, but honest reflections.

And yes, we made room for the doubts too. 
Imposter syndrome? 
_Still there._ 
Pressure to “know everything”? 
_Big time._ 
But naming those things out loud felt empowering.

###  Why This Matters (To Us)
We didn’t start **JCast** to chase followers or become tech influencers.
We started it because we craved something real. 
A space where developers — from juniors to seniors — could hear honest conversations about *what it’s like to grow in this craft*.

Yes, we talk about tech:
Clean Architecture, UI/UX, cloud, security, testing, tooling — the kind of topics we wrestle with every day. 
But we approach them the way we do with each other at work: _With curiosity, nuance, and zero gatekeeping._

**JCast** isn’t about preaching best practices from an ivory tower. 
It’s about sharing the messy middle. 
The questions we’re still exploring. 
The patterns we’re still figuring out. 
And yeah, the things we’ve messed up and learned from.

It’s about:
* Real talk over buzzwords
* Growth over gatekeeping
* Questions over certainty
* Laughter over lectures

We want **JCast** to be a place where learning feels natural, not forced. 
Where technical depth and personal growth go hand in hand. 
And where listeners feel like they’re not just tuning in — they’re part of the conversation.

If you’ve ever felt unsure, overwhelmed, or just excited about where tech is going — you’re in the right place.

**I fucking love my job.**

Being a programmer in this team is one of the best things that has happened to me.
The fact that I get paid to learn every single day?
That's insane.

One of the things that excites me the most is realizing that everything I know right now is probably just 1% of everything there is to know.
There is always more, new languages, new frameworks, new concepts, new ways to solve problems, and a lot more of new things.
Every day I discover something new, refine what I already know, and push myself to think differently.

What makes it even more fun is that there is rarely just one way to solve a problem.
The discussions that happen because of it?
**I fucking love it.**
More then often there is no right or wrong, just different perspectives, different trade-offs and a shared commitment to writing the best possible code.
And those discussions, those moments when someone suggests an approach I never considered.
I love this fucking job.

I also appreciate the culture of this team.
Everyone is willing to help, share their knowledge.
It's a space where I am being encouraged to ask questions, to challenge their ideas, and experiment without fear.

At the end of the day, I code because I love it.
I love it.
I love the problem-solving, the creativity, the evolution I made.
And being in a team that makes it so easy, to do it.

This is just so fucking cool, man.

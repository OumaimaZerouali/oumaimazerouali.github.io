I’ve always known I wanted to make a podcast. Seriously, the idea had been floating in my head for a while, and I even pitched it to a few friends.  
The result? Not exactly a smashing success. They nodded, smiled, said *“cool idea”*, and went about their lives.

But then Viktor, a colleague, came up with the same idea, and suddenly something concrete started to take shape.  
We talked a few times about it, but until then, it was mostly enthusiasm but nothing tangible.  
Just the desire to create something people would enjoy and that we would have fun making.


## From Idea to Reality

Then Maarten, our people manager, stepped in. What a character. It literally took him a few seconds to be fully on board… and he came with concrete actions immediately.  
That moment was a wake-up call: this could actually happen.

After that, we had a brainstorming session.  
Name? Check.  
Ideas? Check.  
Fun intros? Check.  
Plan of attack? Check.  
The first session was recorded with cheap microphones, a bit rattly, but that actually gave it some charm. Feedback came in: some things needed tweaking, audio could be better, the flow needed tightening.

Second attempt: much better. In the meantime, Maarten and I built the website, Viktor handled all the copy-paste work, and Maarten posted updates on LinkedIn. That’s how JCast really started to take shape.

And now, a year later, all I can say is: **wow**.  
A year of making JCast, and I’ve learned so much I hardly know where to start.


## The Awkwardness and the Stress

I’ve always been scared of speaking in front of people. Writing is so much easier; talking suddenly makes everything feel vulnerable.  
I also tend to use street language in conversations, and this was about Java development, would people take me seriously? That thought caused **a lot of stress** at first.

The first episodes were a rollercoaster: nerves, improvisation, sometimes even a bit of panic.  
But I was 100% committed: picking topics, inviting guests, publishing episodes on time, building a semi-automated pipeline. Everything was well thought out and I wanted it to feel professional, but still authentic.

Still, one episode went a little off-track. The episode about people skills with Bjorn as a guest was fantastic. He was honest, direct, and articulated exactly what I was feeling.  
And that moment… damn!  
I had no idea that such a confrontation could be part of making a podcast.  
It felt like someone had looked straight into your soul, but it taught me **a lot about vulnerability and authenticity**.


## Creativity and Small Wins

After some refinements, we also launched Instagram.  
I manage the account, and being creative is something I really enjoy.  
Canva and I are now best friends. I design visuals, post quotes, create teaser posts. The views aren’t massive, but that doesn’t matter, the process itself is energizing.

Then came the JCast t-shirts.  
I got to design them, and what a hit!  
They were originally only for the JCast crew, but soon people outside our team were ordering them too.  
That feeling – that something you’ve poured your creative energy into makes other people happy – is priceless.

Other small wins:

* Spotify comments that make you pause and smile
* Feedback on LinkedIn or Instagram that warms your heart
* Messages from listeners checking in after each episode to say they enjoyed it

These little things are what make keeping a podcast going truly worthwhile.


## What I Didn’t Expect

Honestly? I thought: we’ll make a podcast about Java, share some knowledge, maybe it’ll be fun, maybe not. But it became so much more:

* **Personal growth**: From someone scared to speak to someone semi-comfortable behind the mic
* **Real connections**: With guests, listeners, and especially my co-hosts
* **Creativity**: Instagram, t-shirt design, website development, all things I love doing
* **Community impact**: People enjoy our content, learn something, and have a laugh

And yes, I didn’t expect to enjoy the **small things** so much: a fun graphic post, a funny intro, or someone sharing your playlist. Those moments are pure gold.


## Reflection: Proud of My Co-Hosts

Now, nearly a year later, all I can do is be proud of my co-hosts: Maarten and Viktor.

Without them, this wouldn’t have worked.  
Without them, it wouldn’t have been fun.  
Without them, it wouldn’t have been JCast.  
Fantastic people, just as committed as I am, and together we built something I’m genuinely happy about.

JCast isn’t just a podcast about Java; it’s a learning journey, a creative outlet, and proof that a small idea, with the right people, can grow into something to be proud of.

And we’re far from done. Season 2, here we come!
